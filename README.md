Project 1 : Date Night
===============================

Description 
------------
Date Night is a tool that couples, friends, and families can use to decide on a date/activity to do when everyone isn't sure, or can't agree on one. It makes the choice for you to give you more time to get on that date rather than stuck in the planning phase. 

How it does this is by allowing the user to add their own ideas to this list of dates. Once the list is to their liking then they will click the button that will randomly select the date for them. 

They can hover over the dates to get an idea of what they can do if that date gets chosen.
