Project 1 : Date Night
===============================

Description 
------------
Date Night is a tool that couples, friends, and families can use to decide on a date/activity to do when everyone isn't sure, or can't agree on one. It makes the choice for you to give you more time to get on that date rather than stuck in the planning phase. 

How it does this is by allowing the user to select from a basic list of ideas to add to "their" list. Users can also add their own ideas to the list by writing them out. Once the list is to their liking then they will click the button that will randomly select the date for them. 

If the date selected was to have a Netflix night OR the user just wants some help selecting a show or movie to watch then they can use the button (hooked up to the Netflix Roulette API) to get an answer.
